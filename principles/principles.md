# Basic Principles

The Croker Method uses mainly 3 principles:

1. **Contexts and context-instances:** It is not only concepts that knowledge workers find themselves trying to explain. There could be instances when knowledge workers need to explain processes, ideas, algorithms, and literally any piece of knowledge. In the ``Croker Method`` these are gathered under the term *contexts*. A context is a _grouping of similar situations_. 

    Think of the famous phrase *"All animals are equal but some are more equal than others."* There are many animals in the world, but clearly we can draw connective lines between some of them to group them in a particular category. For example, should we have a ``cat``, a ``hen`` and a ``tiger``, we can draw a line between the ``cat`` and the ``tiger`` in a category we can call ``feline animals``. Similarly, however, we can also draw a line joining ``cat`` with ``hen`` in a category we will call ``farm animals``. Both are very valid connections. In the ``Croker Method`` we call these groupings and categories as ``contexts``.

    Within every context we have the concepts, ideas, processes, and other instances of that context from which we are drawing features. We call these *context-instances*.

2. **Orders of magnitude:** The relationship between elements within a context can be expressed in orders of magnitude. The weight will depend upon the situation that the knowledge worker is trying to examine.

    Back to the animal example, let us say that we're examining specifically the ``cat``. If the context was ``Animal Roles in Farms``, a higher order of ``cat`` can be a ``guard dog`` as it has a more authoritative role within the farm, while a lower order of the ``cat`` can be a ``mouse`` as many times it is an unwanted guest. Should we be seeing the ``cat`` in the context of ``Zoo`` we can say that higher order context-instances would be a ``lama`` and an ``elephant``, since both animals are physically bigger than a ``cat``, while a smaller order context-instance will be a ``green finch``.

3. **Analogies as parallel contexts:** Since analogies emerge out of similar patterns in different contexts, we like to think of analogies as *parallel contexts*.

    In the animal example, a ``guard dog`` is more authoritative than a ``cat`` in an ``Animal Roles in Farms`` context just like the ``best-man`` is more authoritative than the ``waiter`` in a ``Family Wedding`` context. Both the ``guard dog`` and the ``best-man`` have a guarding role in their contexts, and hence are good analogies to each other.
