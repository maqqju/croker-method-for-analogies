# Examples

In this section you will find a number of examples of how the ``Croker Method`` can be applied.

## Example 1 : Innovating an Event

The ``Croker Method`` is particularly useful when you need to innovate something which is organized frequently. Consider, for example, a software company that would like to add some new elements to its annual hackaton. Such events tend to become repetitive since many times the organizers would find it difficult to reinvent every year. Although it is true that online there are myriad resources, sometimes you just need to get the gist of the direction you want to take.

How can we enhance the annual hackaton? Let us apply the steps explained in the [How To section](/howto/howto.md).
