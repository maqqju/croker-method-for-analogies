## <a name="axis"></a>Step 1 - Draw the axis

The very first thing you need to do to use the ``Crocker Method`` is to draw the axis which will essentially be the space holding your ideas.

1. **Find a clear space** where you can jolt down words and ideas. Make sure you have plenty of place as in the ``Crocker Method`` ideas can run like wildfire.
2. **Draw a vertical line** with arrows at both tips. This is the line which will define *orders of magnitude* for contexts.
3. **Draw a horizontal line** this time without any arrows. Make it nice and wide, allowing you to experiment with as many analogies as you want.

**Note:** Are the arrows necessary in the vertical axis? The arrows are there to mainly remind you the function of the vertical line. Context instances written on top are considered to be of a higher order than those written lower down.

## <a name="subject"></a>Step 2 - Place your starting context-instance in the middle of the axis

Whenever using analogies we can safely say that there are, at least, two main *context-instances*:

  * The **subject** which we want to explain
  * The **analogy** which we're using the explain the subject.

Despite the fact that both the subject and the analogy are called *context-instances* in the ``Crocker Method``, *the subject* is the *starting point* of the exercise. This holds for both cases discussed in [Usages](/usages/usages.md).

As a starting point, therefore, *we place the subject in the middle* of the axis.

Write the starting point in the middle of the axis. This will also help you remember where you started from.

![Draw the axis and place your current context in the middle][1]

**Note:** In the images within this guide we will see that context-instances will be written in bold and underline, similar to a header within an article. The most important thing is that you adopt a convension which will help you differentiate the name of the context-instace from its features.

## <a name="features"></a>Step 3 - Break down the context-instance into features

The next thing you need to do is to start breaking your context-instance into *features*. Features are attributes of your context-instance which will be the key elements in your quest of finding an appropriate analogy to your subject. Think of a feature as the key attributes binding your context-instance to its context. These will be different with every context.

For instance, a ``cat`` under the context ``Farm Animals`` can have features like *good hunter*, *works behind the scenes*, *clears unwanted guests*. In another context, say ``Feline Animals``, however, a ``cat`` can have features like *small*, *domestic*, *independent* and so on.


![Break down your current context into features][2]

**Note:** A tip from the author: do not limit yourself when writing features. It is easier to clean up extra features than to come up with good ones. Instead, try to beat features with even better ones.

## <a name="parallel"></a>Step 4 - Draw a parallel context

Now that you have named your context-instance and justified why and how it pertains to its context, you are ready to start experimenting with analogies (a.k.a. parlallel contexts).

Go to the left or to the right of your original context axis, and draw another vertical line. Write the name of the first context-instance in-line with the subject. This will be your first analogy. Beneath the context-instance name write down those features which it shares with the subject. This will help you justify *why* it is being considered as a potential analogy to your subject.

It could be the case that the parallel context-instance does not inherit all of the features from the subject. That's usually fine as, afterall, analogies don't make the two context-instances equal.

Finally, feel free to add any features that you did not list down in the subject. This could be the first step in refining your ideas and choose the right analogy.

![Draw a parallel context][3]

**Note:** In the image above the parallel context was drawn as a dotted line. It is purely up to you how to represent it. Likewise, note that no arrows have been drawn this time. Remember that the arrows were initially drawn in the original context to remind you of the up/down function in the ``Crocker Method``. A pair is more than enough :).

**Note:** In the image above the parallel context was drawn *on the left hand side* of the original context. This is completely up to you.

**Note:** You are encouraged to draw as many parallel contexts as you wish in a single sitting using the ``Crocker Method``. Feel free to place these left, right as you wish. This is the main reason why it was suggested that you use as much space as you can, so that you are free to experiment and explore.

## <a name="magnitude"></a>Step 5 - Scale up or down

The final feature in the ``Crocker Method`` is to explore different orders of magnitude within the same context. This is represented by going higher or lower on the vertical axis, above the related context-instance.

The most important thing to keep in mind when shifting orders of magnitude is to stick to the conventions for the context-instances in your ``Crocker Method`` space. In the case of this guide, *context-instance names* are written in bold and underline while *features* written underneath as bullet points.

Write the name for the higher (or lower) order of magnitude context-instance and write down the features justifying why it belongs to the context and, most especially, what makes it of a higher (or lower) order of magnitude.

Referring to the example above, in the ``Farm Animals`` context, a ``dog`` is of a higher order than a ``cat`` because it is *a leader*, *has knowledge about the farm*, and *is  the farm owner's best friend*.

You can do this either in the parallel context, (e.g. ``Context-Instance 2``, as seen below).

![Scale up or down - Either in the parallel context][4]


You can also do this in the original context-instance (a.k.a the subject, or ``Context-Instance 1`` in the image below).

![Scale up or down - Or in the original context][5]

The examples above show how you can go to a higher order context-instance. Similarly, context-instances can be of a lower order of magnitude, as below.

![Scale up or down - scaling low][6]

**Note:** When writing down features for the new (higher or lower order of magnitude) context-instance, *focus on the relationship between this context-instance and its context*. Then, when ready, take a step back and *look at the whole* ``Crocker Method`` space. You will be surprised with the new connections that you can start to make.
